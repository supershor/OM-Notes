    Hello everyone,

    I'm Ashish Sahu, an Android Developer Intern passionate about creating impactful apps. ðŸ“±âœ¨

    This Notes App project was assigned by Internshala, and I completed it in just one day (yes, burning the midnight oil! ðŸ˜‚).
    I've used SQLite and Shared Preferences, following the assignment guidelines of having only one main activity.

    But that's not all! I'm excited to enhance this app further, adding both offline and online accessibility features.
    If anyone from Internshala is reading this, I hope you'll appreciate my work.
    Even if I face rejection, I'm grateful to Internshalaâ€”it's where I got my first internship breakthrough. ðŸ™Œ

    I'm eager to contribute more to Internshala because I believe in its mission. Enjoy using this app, and feel free to reach out!
