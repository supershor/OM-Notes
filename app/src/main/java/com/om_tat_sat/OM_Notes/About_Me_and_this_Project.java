    Hello Everyone

    This is Ashish Sahu,

    This is a Notes App assignment that was given by internshala to me for a better understanding of me.
    I completed this project in 1 day.( Raat bhar jagna pada ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ )
    I have only used SQLite, Shared Preferences and only one main activity as asked in the assignment.
    And now I am thinking of making this app more better, once I have completed this assignment using both offline and online accessibility.
    And if anyone from Intershala is reading I hope to hear positive about my application.
    Even if I get rejected please do let me know because Internshala holds a position in my heart as it helped
    me a lot, it was the only place where I got my first break through as a intern.
    I would love to contribute to Internshala, and I believe I have the capability to do so.
    Hope you all enjoy this app

    Thanks for reading
    Ashish Sahu
